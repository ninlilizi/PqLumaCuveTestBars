# Pq Luma Cuve Test-Bars
ST.2084 PQ Curve visualisation test-bar generator

#### NOTE: As this renders in PQ space you must have HDR enabled in your OS for correct results!

This is a simple tool to visualise a sub-section of the PQ curve.

I made this to help debug issues with the curve of my PG39WCDM monitor, as after fixing all other issues with it's terrible out the factory calibration I was left with a toe cliff resulting in ugly black smearing at the bottom of it's luminance range.

If you find yourself with a similar problamatic monitor in need of a custom profile to fix it, this will help you tune the luminance levels at the bottom of the curve. Frankly, I'm beginning to question if all WOLED monitors suffer from this issue to some degree as a natural quirk of that white pixel.
